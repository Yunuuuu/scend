<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Installation

You can install the development version of scend from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("pak")) {
    install.packages("pak",
        repos = sprintf(
            "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/devel/%s/%s/%s",
            .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch
        )
    )
}
pak::pkg_install("Yunuuuu/scend")
```

## Introduction

[scrapper](https://github.com/libscran/scrapper) is a package provides
methods for an end-to-end analysis of a single-cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq) analysis, starting from the count matrix and finishes with
clusters, markers, and various embeddings (i.e., t-SNE and UMAP). Itâ€™s
pretty fast and memory-efficient. The package serves as a bridging tool
connecting the `scrapper` package with either `Seurat` or
`SingleCellExperiment` objects.

Description: 'scrapper' is a package provides methods for an end-to-end analysis 
    of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, starting from the 
    count matrix and finishes with clusters, markers, and various embeddings 
    (i.e., t-SNE and UMAP). It's pretty fast and memory-efficient. 'scend' serves 
    as a bridging tool connecting the `scrapper` package with either `Seurat` or 
    `SingleCellExperiment` objects.
